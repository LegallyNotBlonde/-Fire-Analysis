## Short Project Overview 

<p> We started with original data in PDF format, with each year in a separate file. 
<p> Using code, we extracted this data into Excel, parsed the relevant pages, and transformed it into key metrics using Pandas libraries. 
<p> We then created an SQL schema to store the data and used JavaScript to build HTML pages with interactive dashboards. 
<p> Pandas was also used for various visualizations. Due to our group's limited size and time constraints, we divided the project into smaller tasks, allowing us to work in parallel. 
<p> This approach has lead to multiple code files in this repository.

### Purpose
* This study is for educational purposes only. We are aware that fires are common in California.
* We analyzed the frequency of these fires, the damage they cause, and whether some counties experience more fires than others, highlighting regions at higher risk.
* Additionally, we explored whether the number and impact of fires have consistently increased over the years or if they have fluctuated.

### Key Findings and Charts
* We identified key metrics characterizing fires and included them in our presentation.
* Below are some of the graphs.

#### *Please find more details in the separate presentation included in this repo.*

### Conclusion
The number of fires fluctuate year by year and there is no consistent growth.
However, on average fire burn during 13 days a month with astronomical financial losses.

### Additional Interesting Findings
While reviewing yearly statistics, we noticed that fires in 2020 alone cost California over $4 million.  
<p> If we were advising government officials, it would be prudent to investigate the costs of preventative measures. 
<p>Although such investments might seem substantial, they could potentially be more cost-effective than the catastrophic damages caused by wildfires in California.
