## Short Project Overview 
**The Growing Threat of Wildfires**
> We started with original data in PDF format, with each year in a separate file. 
> Using code, we extracted this data into Excel, parsed the relevant pages, and transformed it into key metrics using Pandas libraries. 
> We then created an SQL schema to store the data and used JavaScript to build HTML pages with interactive dashboards. Pandas was also used for various visualizations. 
> Due to our group's limited size and time constraints, we divided the project into smaller tasks, allowing us to work in parallel. This approach is why you'll find multiple code files in this repository.



### Purpose

* In this study we pursue an educational goal only. Many of us are aware that fires are not rare in California. 
<p> In this project we analysed how often they really happen, the damage they make, and if some counties had more fires than others, highlighting the higher risks of fires in those regions.
* Additionally, we explored if the number of fires and their impact consistently grew year over year or it fluctuated.
___

### Project Objective

* Analyze historical wildfire data from 2008-2022 by county in California.
* Focus on the number of fires, their duration, the area affected, and the impact on human lives (deaths, injuries, financial losses).
* Provide insights into the frequency, severity, and impacts of wildfires.

### Conclusion

### Additional interesting findings
While reviewing the yearly statistics, we observed that fires in 2020 alone cost California over $4 million. If we were advising government officials, it would be prudent to consider exploring the costs of preventative measures. Although such investments might appear substantial, they could potentially be more cost-effective than the catastrophic damages caused by wildfires in California.
